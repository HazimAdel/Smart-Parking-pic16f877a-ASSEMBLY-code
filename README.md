# Smart-Parking-pic16f877a-ASSEMBLY-code
In this project I made an two floor parking each floor has two IR sensors one for entrance and other for exit this floor, 
the maximum capacity of cars is ( 15 ), 
the ground floor's lights it's work for 1s when a whenever a car enter, the basement floor's light it depend on it's day or night outside using LDR sensor, 
this work by using two microcontroller on that read the sensors and controlling the lights for each floor 
after that transmitting the number of cars using USART and another receive from the first one and display number of cars on 2-digit 7-segment display for each floor.
